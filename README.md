- 👋 Hi, I’m @amritmandzakheer
- 👀 I’m interested in data, analysis, research - especially on social issues
- 🌱 I’m currently learning data analysis, python, and statistics
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on easy analysis projects
- 📫 How to reach me: amrit.s.heer@gmail.com

I have a PhD in Philosophy, where I studied the history of logic and its relationship to how we think about the basic structure of the world. I'm looking to move out of academic and turn my passion for logic, analysis, research, and learning about the world into a new career!
